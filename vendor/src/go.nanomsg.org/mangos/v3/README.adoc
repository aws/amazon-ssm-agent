|===
|_Mangos&trade;_  is an implementation in pure Go of the *SP*
("`Scalability Protocols`") messaging system.
These are colloquially  known as a "`nanomsg`".

|===

IMPORTANT: The import path has _changed_! Please change any references
from `nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2` to `go.nanomsg.org/mangos/v3`.
The old v2 imports will still work for old applications, provided that
a sufficiently modern version of Go is used.  However, no further work
will be done on v2.

TIP: Versions 1 and 2 of mangos were at different import locations.
Those versions will still inter-operate with this version, except that
within the same process the `inproc` transport can only be used by
consumers using the same version of mangos.

The modern C implementation of the SP protocols is available as
https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[__NNG&trade;__].

The original implementation of the SP protocols is available as
http://www.nanomsg.org[__nanomsg&trade;__].

Generally (modulo a few caveats) all of these implementations can inter-operate.

The design is intended to make it easy to add new transports with almost
trivial effort, as well as new topologies ("`protocols`" in SP parlance.)

At present, all of the Req/Rep, Pub/Sub, Pair, Bus, Push/Pull, and
Surveyor/Respondent patterns are supported.
This project also supports an experimental protocol called Star.

Supported transports include TCP, inproc, IPC, WebSocket, WebSocket/TLS and TLS.

Basic interoperability with nanomsg and NNG has been verified (you can do
so yourself with `nanocat` and `macat`) for all protocols and transports
that _NNG_ and _nanomsg_ support, except for the _ZeroTier_ transport and the PAIRv1
protocol, which are only supported in _NNG_ at this time.

There are a number of projects that use these products together.

// There is a third party experimental QUIC transport available at
// [quic-mangos](https://github.com/lthibault/quic-mangos).
// (An RFE to make this transport official exists.)

// If you find this useful, I would appreciate knowing about it.  I can be reached
// via my email address, garrett -at- damore -dot- org

== Documentation

For docs, see https://godoc.org/go.nanomsg.org/mangos or run:

    $ godoc -http=:6060

then see http://localhost:6060/pkg/go.nanomsg.org/mangos/

== Testing

This package supports internal self tests, which can be run in
the idiomatic Go way.
(Note that most of the tests are in a test subdirectory.)

    $ go test go.nanomsg.org/mangos/v3/...

There are also internal benchmarks available:

    $ go test -bench=. go.nanomsg.org/mangos/v3/test

== Commercial Support

mailto:info@staysail.tech[Staysail Systems, Inc.] offers
http://staysail.tech/support/mangos[commercial support] for mangos.

== Examples

Some examples are posted in the directories under `examples/` in this project.

These examples are rewrites (in Go) of Tim Dysinger's
http://nanomsg.org/gettingstarted/index.html[Getting Started with Nanomsg].

Running `go doc` in the example directories will yield information about how
to run each example program.

Enjoy!
