= Changes in Version 3

== Import path changed

Use `go.nanomsg.org/mangos/v3` as the base URL for imports.

== Go v1.12 Or Better Required

We're using modules and semantic versions.
These are understood by recent Go versions, and well supported only
in version 1.12 and newer.
It may be possible to make 1.11 or 1.10 work, but it is unsupported.

== Forward Plans

The next batch of changes for mangos is likely to add a lot of
convenience routines.  Thus we expect to see minor version v3.1 and
so forth.  We'll document those changes as they appear here.
