// Package ansi provides ansi escape sequence processing as defined by the
// ECMA-48 standard "Control Functions for Coded Character Sets - Fifth Edition"
//
// From the standard:
//
//   Free printed copies of this standard can be ordered from:
//   ECMA
//   114 Rue du RhoÌ‚ne CH-1204 Geneva Switzerland
//   Fax: +41 22 849.60.01 Email: documents@ecma.ch
//   Files of this Standard can be freely downloaded from the ECMA web site
//   (www.ecma.ch). This site gives full information on ECMA, ECMA activities,
//   ECMA Standards and Technical Reports.
//
// Portions of the standared are included in the documentation for this package.
// The standard bears no copyright.
//
// Each escape sequence is represented by a string constant and a Sequence
// structure.  For the escape sequence named SEQ, SEQ is the string constant and
// SEQ_ is the related Sequence structure.  A mapping from a sequence string to
// its Sequence structure is provided in Table.
//
// Some escape sequences may contain parameters, for example "\033[4A".  This
// sequence contains the parameter "4".  The name of the sequences is "\033[A"
// (the parameter is missing).  The sequence "\033[1;2 c" is named "\033[ c" and
// has the parameters "1", and "2".
//
// The C1 control set has both a two byte and a single byte representation.  The
// two byte representation is an Escape followed by a byte in the range of 0x40
// to 0x5f.  They may also be specified by a single byte in the range of 0x80 -
// 0x9f.  This ansi package always names the C1 control set in the two byte
// form.
