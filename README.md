# Amazon SSM Agent

The Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) Agent is software developed for the [Simple Systems Manager Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ssm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html). The SSM Agent is the primary component of a feature called Run Command.

## Overview

The SSM Agent runs on EC2 instances and enables you to quickly and easily execute remote commands or scripts against one or more instances. The agent uses SSM [documents](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ssm/latest/APIReference/aws-ssm-document.html). When you execute a command, the agent on the instance processes the document and configures the instance as specified.
Currently, the agent and Run Command enable you to quickly run Shell scripts on an instance using the AWS-RunShellScript SSM document. 
SSM Agent also enables the Session Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instance through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI. The first time a Session Manager session is started on an instance, the agent will create a user called "ssm-user" with sudo or administrator privilege. Session Manager sessions will be launched in context of this user.

### Building inside docker container (Recommended)
* Install docker: [Install CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)

* Build image
```
docker build -t ssm-agent-build-image .
```
* Build the agent
```
docker run -it --rm --name ssm-agent-build-container -v `pwd`:/amazon-ssm-agent ssm-agent-build-image make build-release
```

### Building on Linux

* Install go [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install)

* Install rpm-build and rpmdevtools

* [Cross Compile SSM Agent](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/10/cross-compile-your-go-programs.html)

* Run `make build` to build the SSM Agent for MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD and Windows environment.

* Run `make build-release` to build the agent and also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package.

The following folders are generated when the build completes:
```
bin/darwin_amd64
bin/darwin_arm64
bin/freebsd_386
bin/freebsd_amd64
bin/linux_386
bin/linux_amd64
bin/linux_arm
bin/linux_arm64
bin/windows_386
bin/windows_amd64
```
* To enable the Agent for Session Manager scenario on Windows instances
    * Clone the repo from https://github.com/masatma/winpty.git
    * Follow instructions on https://github.com/rprichard/winpty to build winpty 64-bit binaries
    * Copy the winpty.dll and winpty-agent.exe to the bin/SessionManagerShell folder
For the Windows Operating System, Session Manager is only supported on Windows Server 2008 R2 through Windows Server 2019 64-bit versions.

Please follow the user guide to [copy and install the SSM Agent](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-ssm-agent.html)

### Code Layout

* Source code
    * Core functionality such as worker management is under core/
    * Agent worker code is under agent/
    * Other functionality such as IPC is under common/
* Vendor package source code is under vendor/src
* rpm and dpkg artifacts are under packaging
* build scripts are under Tools/src

### Linting

To lint the entire module call the `lint-all` target. This executes golangci-lint on all packages in the module.
You can configure golangci-lint with different linters using the `.golangci.yml` file.

For golangci-lint installation instructions see https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/
For more information on the golangci-lint configuration file see https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/
For more information on the linters used see https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/

### GOPATH

To use vendor dependencies, the suggested GOPATH format is `:<packagesource>/vendor:<packagesource>`
